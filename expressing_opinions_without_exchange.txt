This is particularly true in cases of domestic violence and suicide.

4. **Military Parallels**: Despite the historical context of the right to bear arms, modern societies have professional armies to defend their citizens and territories. Allowing individual civilians to own firearms does not provide an effective deterrent against external threats. Instead, it risks escalating conflicts and increasing the potential for harm within communities.
