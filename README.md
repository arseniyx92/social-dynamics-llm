Maybe lack of samples (10 LLM calls for each number of arguments). But only positivewise grading effect visible.

### Interesting ways of llama's thinking.

Here as we can see the model says that the opinion does not go against the statement (is not negative about it) because is does not use negative language.

```
PROMPTS:
Classify given opinion about the statement: `People should have a right to keep and bear arms.`.  Return number from 0 to 5 where 0 mean that opinion is completely negative about the statement and 5 that opinion is completely positive about it, so 3 is neutral. "Ugh, can we please not even think about making guns more accessible? I know some people say it's for self-defense and property protection, but to me, that just seems like a euphemism for 'I want to be able to shoot things and hurt people'. And don't even get me started on the risk of accidental shootings. It's not worth it. The economic burden alone is staggering - we can't afford to have more guns out there causing chaos and destruction. I'm not buying into the militia nonsense either... let's just keep our guns locked away where they belong." 
###########################
OUTPUT: I'd classify this opinion as a 4 out of 5. The person is strongly opposed to making guns more accessible and believes it's not worth the risks and economic burden. They express concerns about accidental shootings, chaos, and destruction, and dismiss the idea of self-defense and property protection as a euphemism for violence. However, they don't use overtly negative language or make sweeping statements that would categorize their opinion as 0.

Agent1's message:  Honestly, I've been giving this topic a lot of thought lately and I'm still torn. On the one hand, having the right to bear arms can be a matter of personal safety and security - it's true that self-defense is a crucial aspect of human rights. Plus, a well-regulated militia tradition is an important part of our country's history. However, the risks are real: accidental shootings, economic burdens on healthcare systems, and the risk of guns falling into the wrong hands... I think we need to strike a balance between these competing interests. 

Agent1's polarity:  2 

Agent2's message:  Honestly, I've been thinking about this for a while and I'm still convinced that the right to bear arms is crucial. I mean, think about it - with the primary purpose being self-defense, how can we truly be safe in our own homes? The idea of protection of personal property and having a sense of security for ourselves and our loved ones is just too important to give up. Plus, the militia tradition and national defense aspects are huge. And let's not forget about victims of domestic violence needing access to firearms for survival. It's all about balance, though - we need responsible gun ownership. 

Agent2's polarity:  4 

Agent1's arguments:  Here are the arguments in favor of the statement "People should have a right to keep and bear arms" from the provided text:

1. **Self-Defense**: The original message likely argues that individuals have the right to defend themselves and their families, which is a fundamental aspect of human rights.

2. **Militia Tradition**: The text acknowledges the importance of the militia tradition as part of America's history, suggesting that the Second Amendment was intended to protect individual rights related to defense and security.

3. **Protection of Personal Property**: Some argue that owning firearms allows individuals to protect their property and sense of security, which is a valid consideration.

4. **Mental Health (Counterargument)**: In response to the counterargument about mental health, some might argue that responsible gun ownership can be part of a comprehensive approach to mental health care and can provide a sense of empowerment for individuals with conditions.

5. **Gun-Free Zones**: Some argue that designating certain areas as gun-free zones does not necessarily increase safety, but rather creates restrictions on law-abiding citizens' rights to bear arms in those areas.

6. (Implicit) The text itself acknowledges the value of personal safety and security without explicitly advocating for the complete removal of regulations. 
=====
 Here are the counterarguments against the statement "People should have a right to keep and bear arms" from the provided text:

1. Self-Defense: While self-defense is a legitimate reason for owning firearms, it's not the only consideration.
2. Protection of Personal Property: Firearms can indeed provide a sense of security, but this comes at a significant cost in terms of risk and potential harm to others.
3. Militia Tradition: The militia tradition is an important part of our country's history, but modern-day militias are not representative of the original intent of the Second Amendment.

Note that these counterarguments do not necessarily argue against the right to self-defense or personal property protection entirely, but rather suggest that alternative methods can be used to achieve those goals without resorting to firearms. 

Agent2's message:  "Honestly, I've always been super passionate about the right to bear arms. To be honest with you, I was worried at first that people would say it's just for self-defense and hunting, but the more I think about it, the more I realize how crucial it is for so many reasons. Not only can it protect my family and home (self-defense and personal property), but it also reflects our country's militia tradition and allows us to contribute to national defense. Plus, it can be a means of preparedness during emergencies...I think it's just too important to give up" 

Agent2's polarity:  4 

Agent1's arguments:  Here are the arguments in favor of the statement "People should have a right to keep and bear arms" from the provided text:

1. **Individual Autonomy**: Owning firearms allows individuals to take control of their own safety and security, which is essential for personal autonomy.
2. **Rural Livelihoods**: For many people living in rural areas, firearms are necessary for hunting, ranching, and other forms of self-sufficiency.
3. **Community Defense**: Firearm ownership can also be a means of community defense, where individuals come together to protect their neighborhoods and communities from threats. 
=====
 Here are the arguments against the statement "People should have a right to keep and bear arms" as listed in the provided text:

1. **Public Health Concerns**: The availability of firearms contributes to higher rates of gun-related violence, accidents, and suicides, which have significant public health implications.
2. **Economic Burden**: The economic costs of treating gun-related injuries and deaths are substantial, and may be outweighed by the benefits of stricter gun control measures.
3. **Technological Advancements**: Firearms technology has advanced significantly in recent years, making it easier for individuals to become proficient with firearms without proper training or oversight.

Note that these arguments do not explicitly use the phrase "people should have a right to keep and bear arms", but rather present counterpoints to the idea of granting this specific right. 

Agent1's message:  Honestly, I'm still trying to wrap my head around this issue. On one hand, I can see the value in having firearms for personal protection and self-sufficiency, especially for people living in rural areas. It's also true that some folks might feel a sense of security and autonomy when owning guns. However, every time I think about it, I'm reminded of the devastating consequences of gun violence - from public health concerns to economic burdens on our healthcare system. Plus, with advancements in tech, I worry that easier access to firearms could lead to more accidents and misuse.

Agent1's message:  "Hey guys, I've been thinking about the whole 'right to bear arms' thing and honestly, I'm still not sure where I stand. On one hand, I get the importance of self-defense and protecting personal property - it's a fundamental right, after all. But on the other hand, the thought of accidental shootings, easy access to firearms by children and mentally unstable individuals, and the sheer number of gun-related deaths in our country is just heartbreaking. And let's not forget about the economic burden of gun violence... I think we need to find a balance here." 

Agent1's polarity:  2 

Agent2's message:  Honestly, I used to think the right to bear arms was super important, but the more I thought about it, the more I'm like, "Hold up". I mean, don't get me wrong, self-defense and all that is great and all, but can we talk about how many accidental shootings happen?! It's like, what if you have a kid in the house and they're playing with your gun? Or what if you're just having a bad day and you accidentally pull the trigger?! The risks are real, folks. And let's not forget about domestic violence... it's a serious issue. 

Agent2's polarity:  3 

Agent1's arguments:  Here are the arguments in favor of the statement "People should have a right to keep and bear arms":

1. **Self-Defense**: The importance of protecting oneself and one's family from harm is a fundamental right.
2. **Protection of Personal Property**: Firearms provide a sense of security for personal property, such as homes, businesses, and valuables.
3. **Militia Tradition**: The concept of a well-regulated militia reflects the importance of citizen-soldiers in defending the country against external threats.
4. **Regulation vs. Restriction**: Stricter regulations on firearms may not necessarily eliminate the risks associated with their use but can help minimize them.

Note that the original text presents these four arguments as points in favor of having a right to keep and bear arms, while also acknowledging potential drawbacks and counterarguments. 
=====
 Here are the arguments against the statement "People should have a right to keep and bear arms":

1. Risk of Accidental Shootings
2. Economic Burden (gun-related injuries and deaths result in significant economic burdens)
3. Easy Access to Firearms by Children and Mentally Unstable Individuals (with insufficient background checks and regulations)
4. Gun Violence Epidemic (the United States experiences a high rate of gun-related deaths and injuries compared to other developed countries)

These arguments present counterpoints to the original statement, highlighting concerns about public safety, economic costs, and the risks associated with firearms. 

Agent2's message:  "Hey guys, I've been thinking about this whole gun control debate and honestly, I'm torn. On one hand, I get the importance of self-defense and personal property protection. The idea that a well-regulated militia is essential for national defense also resonates with me. But then there are the risks of accidental shootings and the economic burden of gun-related injuries. And let's not forget about domestic violence situations where having a firearm can be both a lifesaver and a curse. I think we need to find a balance between freedom and responsibility." 

Agent2's polarity:  2 

Agent1's arguments:  Here are the arguments in favor of the statement "People should have a right to keep and bear arms" from the provided text:

1. **Personal Responsibility**: Owning a firearm requires significant personal responsibility, including regular training, safe storage, and adherence to regulations.
2. **Limited Government Intervention**: Stricter gun control laws often infringe upon individual freedoms, such as the right to self-defense.
3. **Cultural Significance**: Firearms have played a significant role in American history and culture, particularly in the context of the Second Amendment.
4. **Alternative Solutions**: Instead of relying solely on gun control, alternative solutions like mental health programs, community mediation, and de-escalation training could help reduce gun-related violence.

These arguments emphasize the importance of individual freedom, personal responsibility, and cultural significance in the context of gun ownership, rather than relying solely on restrictive laws to regulate firearms. 
=====
 Here are arguments against the statement "People should have a right to keep and bear arms":

1. **Public Safety**: Allowing people to carry firearms increases the risk of accidents, injuries, and fatalities. Stricter gun control laws can help reduce these risks by regulating access to firearms.
2. **Mental Health Concerns**: Easy access to firearms can enable individuals with mental health issues to harm themselves or others. Restrictive laws could prevent this by limiting access to firearms for people who are deemed unfit or unstable.
3. **Economic Burden of Gun Violence**: The economic costs associated with gun-related injuries and deaths, including healthcare expenses, lost productivity, and funeral costs, can be significant. Stricter regulations may help reduce these costs.
4. **Domestic Violence Concerns**: Firearms can escalate domestic violence situations, putting women and children at risk. Restrictive laws could prevent this by limiting access to firearms for people with a history of abuse or violence.
5. **Lack of Effectiveness in Preventing Crime**: Research suggests that stricter gun control laws are more effective in reducing crime rates than relying solely on individual responsibility and limited government intervention.
6. **International Comparisons**: Many countries with stricter gun control laws have lower rates of gun-related deaths and injuries, suggesting that such regulations can be effective in reducing these risks.
7. **Child Access Prevention**: Even with responsible gun ownership practices, children can still access firearms if left unattended or unsupervised. Restrictive laws could help prevent this risk by regulating the storage and transportation of firearms.
8. **Guns as a Contributing Factor to Mass Shootings**: The presence of firearms has been identified as a contributing factor in many mass shootings, suggesting that stricter regulations could help reduce the risk of such tragedies.

Note: These arguments are not necessarily presented as opposing the statement in its entirety, but rather as counterpoints to some of the arguments made in favor of the statement. 

Agent1's message:  "Honestly, I've been thinking a lot about the right to bear arms and I'm not sure what to think. On one hand, owning a firearm requires a tremendous amount of personal responsibility and can be a vital tool for self-defense. But on the other hand, I worry about the risks of accidents, injuries, and fatalities that come with it. And let's be real, guns have been involved in some pretty tragic mass shootings. I think we need to find a balance between our right to bear arms and keeping ourselves and others safe. Maybe stricter regulations could help?
